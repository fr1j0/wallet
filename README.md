# Wallet

Wallet app with deposit, exchange, transactions and accounts management functionalities.
UI built on React + Redux + Redux Toolkit + Tailwind CSS.
Data is persisted in a JSON file and updated by a json-server.
Formatting and static code analysis are performed by Prettier and ESLint.
For the styling I chose to give a chance to Tailwind CSS and I have to admit that I had some good fun with it.

All exchange ratios are compared to EUR (ratio property in accounts at db.json file)

- 1 EUR - â‚¬1
- 1 EUR - $1.24
- 1 EUR - CHF1.09
